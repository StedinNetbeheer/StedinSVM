=======================================

### Code, images and data used for the Data Science Analytics Community 'Deep Dive Into SVMs' session. 
The `basic_linear_kernel.R` code includes a simple classification example using the famous [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).
*Note* that the data is reduced by removing all the cases of 'versicolor' species so that the problem is reduced to binary classification.
The following plot shows a two dimensional plot of the iris data where the class separation is visible.
